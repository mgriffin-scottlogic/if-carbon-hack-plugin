name: Common Crawl private s3 data estimation
description: |
  An attempt to replicate the carbon results for the private Common Crawl data on s3.
  As described in article here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/environmental-impact-cloud-common-crawl-case-study-julien-nioche-at8xf/?trackingId=XSEL7VNgQlywEWznDFxHZw%3D%3D
  We spoke with the author and Common Crawl's CTO to confirm that the private data is 115 TB in size, or 115,000 Gb for Impact Framework input unit.
  The data was stored from April 2021 to December 2023, 33 months or 86,832,000 seconds for Impact Framework input unit.
  AWS reports the project's total usage as 3.386 metrics tonnes of CO2e, with 35.14% of this being on s3.
  This would translate to around 1.1898 metric tonnes on s3 alone, or 1,189,840g as Impact Framework calculates.
  Our calculations result in an overestimation of ~2,142,000g of CO2e but this could be due to the data increasing over time instead of remaining constant.
